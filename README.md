# Doom-nukem

Here is my final group project of 42 school named Doom-nukem.
We wanted to recreate the video game Duke-nukem from 1996.

### Installing

To install the game follow those commands

```
git clone https://github.com/ochaar/Doom-nukem.git
cd Doom-nukem
make
```
After you 'make', it will automaticaly download SDL for 1:30 min
and compile the project.
